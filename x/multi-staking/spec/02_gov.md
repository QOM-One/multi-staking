## Government Proposal

### Add Bond Token Proposals

We can designate a token as a `bond token` by submiting an `AddBondDenomProposal`. In this proposal, we specify the token's denom and its `BondWeight`, if the proposal passes, the specified token will become a `bond token` with the designated `BondWeight`.
